# 02  Challenge Assignment (Professional Portfolio)

## Description
# User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

# Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

This project's purpose is to display and showcase a website portfolio for hiring companies to view projects of mine that I create. Despite being a new student and not having any portfolio projects, I added placeholders where the projects would be. Regardless, this assignment motivated me to create something I could express on and display what I have learned with Advanced CSS elements. I learned how to use flexboxes, media queries, and advanced CSS elements, properties and tags.
